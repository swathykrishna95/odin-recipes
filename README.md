# odin-recipes

This will be a basic recipe website which provides links to create some tasty indian dishes, across the continent!
The page uses headings, images, paragraphs, links, ordered and unordered lists to create a recipe viewer. The main page index links out to
the other recipes. The images are stored in a separate folder, so are the pages for the recipes. It does not use any CSS or JavaScript as of yet.
